# Comp 4990 - Project (Team-17)
# Web Application for Sequential Recommendation System

## Project Description 
- This work was dedicated to understand the functionality and applicability of reinforcement learning and using it for a sequential recommendation system for movies. It is based on content-filtering. This project uses reinforcement learning techniques specific to on/off policy learning, to train a model to better recommend films to users using the Movielens dataset. The project will be distributed such that primary focus will be on a static recommendation system and will progress to being dynamic sequential recommendation system.

## Built with 
- Python
- JavaScript
- TensorFlow and other ML libraries
- Flask 
- ReactJS
- TMDB API

## Dataset
- MovieLens 1M

## How to run the Project
1. clone the repo
2. cd to the backend and run the server.py (python server.py)
3. In a different prompt, cd to the frontend folder and then type "npm start".

## Functionality
The frontend will have the following functions. 
- Information about the movie recommended will be displayed
- Giving the next recommendation for the user when pressing the "next recommendation" button
- view stats of the choices made
- changing the user id which will change the user the movies are recommended for.
